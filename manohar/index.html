                  Lord of the Flies summary deals with a group of schoolboys who are on a desert island.
                   Furthermore, these boys try to form their own society on this island. The major Lord of
                    the Flies themes are power struggle and rebellion. Ralph is the leader of the group. 
                    Ralph believes that the main goals of the group should be fun, survival, and smoke signal
                     maintenance. The smoke signal could attract the attention of ships or boats. Moreover,
                      Ralph gives daily tasks to boys.

                  The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and
                  began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his
                  school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to
                  him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long
                  scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering
                  heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of
                  red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was
                  echoed by another

                  By the time Ralph finished blowing the conch the platform was crowded.
                  There were differences between this meeting and the one held in the
                  morning. The afternoon sun slanted in from the other side of the platform
                  and most of the children, feeling too late the smart of sunburn, had put
                  their clothes on. The choir, less of a group, had discarded their cloaks.
                  Ralph sat on a fallen trunk, his left side to the sun. On his right were
                  most of the choir; on his left the larger boys who had not known each
                  other before the evacuation; before him small children squatted in the
                  grass

                  Jack was bent double. He was down like a sprinter, his nose only a few
                  inches from the humid earth. The tree trunks and the creepers that fetooned them lost themselves in a green dusk thirty feet above him, and all
                  about was the undergrowth. There was only the faintest indication of a
                  trail here; a cracked twig and what might be the impression of one side of
                  a hoof. He lowered his chin and stared at the traces as though he would
                  force them to speak to him. Then dog-like, uncomfortably on all fours
                  yet unheeding his discomfort, he stole forward five yards and stopped.
                  Here was loop of creeper with a tendril penda

                  The first rhythm that they became used to was the slow swing from dawn
to quick dusk. They accepted the pleasures of morning, the bright sun,
the whelming sea and sweet air, as a time when play was good and life so
full that hope was not necessary and therefore forgotten. Toward noon,
as the floods of light fell more nearly to the perpendicular, the stark colors
of the morning were smoothed in pearl and opalescence; and the heat—
as though the impending sun’s height gave it momentum—became a blow
that they ducked, running to the shade and lying there, perhaps even
sleeping

                  The tide was coming in and there was only a narrow strip of firm beach
                  between the water and the white, stumbling stuff near the palm terrace.
                  Ralph chose the firm strip as a path because he needed to think, and
                  only here could he allow his feet to move without having to watch them.
                  Suddenly, pacing by the water, he was overcome with astonishment. He
                  found himself understanding the wearisomeness of this life, where every path was an improvisation and a considerable part of one’s waking
                  life was spent watching one’s feet. He stopped, facing the strip; and remembering that first enthusiastic exploration as though it were part of a
                  brighter childhood, he smiled jeeringly

                  There was no light left save that of the stars. When they had understood
                  what made this ghostly noise and Percival was quiet again, Ralph and
                  Simon picked him up unhandily and carried him to a shelter. Piggy hung
                  about near for all his brave words, and the three bigger boys went together to the next shelter. They lay restlessly and noisily among the dry
                  leaves, watching the patch of stars that was the opening toward the lagoon. Sometimes a littlun cried out from the other shelters and once a
                  bigun spoke in the dark. Then they too fell asleep

                  The pig-run kept close to the jumble of rocks that lay down by the water
                  on the other side and Ralph was content to follow Jack along it. If you
                  could shut your ears to the slow suck down of the sea and boil of the
                  return, if you could forget how dun and unvisited were the ferny coverts
                  on either side, then there was a chance that you might put the beast out
                  of mind and dream for a while. The sun had swung over the vertical and
                  the afternoon heat was closing in on the island. Ralph passed a message
                  forward to Jack and when they next came to fruit the whole party stopped
                  and ate.

                  Piggy looked up miserably from the dawn-pale beach to the dark mountain.
“Are you sure? Really sure, I mean?”
I told you a dozen times now,” said Ralph, “we saw it.”
“D’you think we’re safe down here?”
“How the hell should I know?”
Ralph jerked away from him and walked a few paces along the beach.
Jack was kneeling and drawing a circular pattern in the sand with his
forefinger. Piggy’s voice came to them, hushed

                  Over the island the build-up of clouds continued. A steady current of
heated air rose all day from the mountain and was thrust to ten thousand
feet; revolving masses of gas piled up the static until the air was ready to
explode. By early evening the sun had gone and a brassy glare had taken
the place of clear daylight. Even the air that pushed in from the sea was
hot and held no refreshment. Colors drained from water and trees and
pink surfaces of rock, and the white and brown clouds brooded. Nothing
prospered but the flies who blackened their lord and made the spilt guts
look like a heap of glistening coal. Even when the vessel broke in Simon’s
nose and the blood gushed out they left him alone, preferring the pig’s
high flavor
